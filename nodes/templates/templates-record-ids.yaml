  name: Template record IDs
  description: 
  details: |
    When a table with columns like "id", "username", "display name" contain
    more than one unique column (in this case, say that both `id` and `username` are unique),
    only show the field that is useful for the use-case.

    In this case, don't show the "id" column, because "username" is already unique, and more
    relevant to the user.

    Other examples:

    * When a row has "id", "reference", the "reference" is unique and useful, so don't show the "id".
    * When a row has "id" and "xuid", only show the "xuid".



    
    Example:

    ```ini
    vendor/
    build/
    ```
